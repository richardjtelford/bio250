## Introduction

Absolute chronology is the basis for all comparison and correlation of Holocene proxy records.

Avoid visual 'curve-matching' 
 - 'reinforcement syndrome' 
 - 'suck-in and smear'

- Mostly <sup>14</sup>C dating and <sup>210</sup>Pb dating. 
- Tephras increasingly important. 
- Holocene-length annually laminated sediments rare.

## Types of Chronologies

Relative vs Absolute

* Incremental
	- Varved sediments
* Radiometric
	- Radiocarbon
	- Lead-210
* Stratigraphic
	- Tephra layers

## Varve formation and preservation

1 Seasonal variation in the type of sediment deposited
- grain size in pro-glacial lake
- biological remains
- Calcite

2 Sediment water interface undisturbed
- by waves & currents
- by bioturbation
- by slumping

## Origin of <sup>14</sup>C

--
Cosmic radiation hits upper atmosphere
--
Nuclei broken into high-energy nucleotides
--
<sup>14</sup>C formed by exchange of p for n in Nitrogen atom
--
<sup>14</sup>C absorbed by biomass and moves through the food chain

Everything is radioactive

## Beta decay of <sup>14</sup>C

$^{14}C → ^{14}N + β + \bar{v}_e$

β – Beta-particle – high energy electron

$\bar{v}_e$ electron antineutrino – very difficult to detect

Random process

Atom has 50% chance of decaying in one half-life yrs

Exponential decay

---
# Measuring <sup>14</sup>C

1 Count the disintegrations  
  - Detect β particles
  - Radiometric or bulk date
  - Needs 1 g carbon
  
2 Count the atoms
  - Accelerated Mass Spectrometer
  - Needs 1 mg carbon
  - Can date specific sediment fractions

$\frac{dA}{dt} = -\lambda A$

$A = A_{initial}e^{-\lambda t}$

$\lambda = \frac{ln(2)}{halflife}$

$A = A_{initial}e^{-ln(2)\frac{age}{halflife}}$

<!-- $ln(\frac{A}{A_{initial}})=-ln(2)\frac{age}{halflife}$ -->

$age = -ln(\frac{A}{A_{initial}})\frac{halflife}{ln(2)}$

Use Libby halflife 5568

$age = -8033 ln(\frac{A}{A_{initial}})$ 

assume $A_{initial} = A_{modern}$ 

$age= -8033 ln(\frac{A}{A_{modern}})$

# Assumptions

1 No contamination
- <sup>14</sup>C tracers
- rootlets
- recrystallisation 
- bioturbation
- coal & peat
	
2 <sup>14</sup>C in organism is in equilibrium with atmosphere at death
- fractionation
- marine reservoir effect
- hardwater error
	
3 Atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C concentration is constant

---
# Isotopic Fractionation

- <sup>14</sup>C is heavier and slower than <sup>12</sup>C
- <sup>14</sup>C discriminated against by photosynthesis & other processes 
- <sup>13</sup>C also discriminated against
- normalise to $\delta ^{13}C = -25 ‰$
- 16 yr offset per 1 ‰


Material |	$\delta ^{13}C ‰$
---------|------------
Marine shells|	+1 ± 2
Speleothems|	-9 ± 3
C-4 plants|	-10 ± 2 
Marine organisms (organic)|	-15 ± 3
Freshwater plants (submerged)|	-16 ± 4
C3 plants, wood, charcoal|	-25 ± 3


---
## Marine reservoir effect 

- Ocean contains lots of C
- Exchange with atmosphere is slow
- <sup>14</sup>C decays before exchange
- →Average apparent age of marine organisms 400 yr too old
